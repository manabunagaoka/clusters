# Legacy: Archetypes v1

This folder marks the archived era of the "Archetypes" approach that tried to generate persona-like cards with aligned evidence. The live code remains in git history:

- Tag: `archetypes-v1.0`
- Branch: `archive/archetypes-v1`

We pivoted to "JTBD Profiles" (one mini-PS per interview) for consistency across domains.
