# Archived Metrics Page

The standalone metrics + readiness step has been removed from the primary user flow.

Reason:
- Flow simplified to: Problem Statement → Interview Themes → Clusters → Insights.
- Metrics and readiness signals will be folded into Insights (future enhancement) rather than a separate page.

If you need the old UI component code, retrieve it from git history at the commit prior to removing `app/(clusters)/metrics/page.tsx`.

Safe to delete this directory once no longer needed for reference.
